# Self-Help-Program
A program that both gives users advice on what to do in case of emergencies, talks to people (almost like an AI companion) and gives information or contacts emergency services should it be deemed necessary. 

Note: While testing, the number that will be used to make sure the app can contact the emergency services will not actually contact them. No need to call them constantly while testing.
